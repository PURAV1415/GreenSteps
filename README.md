## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with developing this application:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    The application uses `genkit` for AI features, which runs on a separate server. You'll need to run both the Next.js app and the Genkit server concurrently.

    In one terminal, run the Genkit development server:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```

    In another terminal, run the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.
